# xenonled
An Adafruit NeoPixel tool for easily previewing and generating Arduino .ino files anywhere.
## About
The purpose of the xenonled project is to provide an easier and more efficient way of working with NeoPixel LEDs. SAPL is an easy to learn language made by me for the xenonled project, and it's main purpose is for generating the graphical preview of each LED strip and the .ino file to run on an Arduino board. Instead of needing an Arduino device, cable, LEDs, and power to test different designs and code, using xenonled eliminates the need for all of those, providing a more portable and cleaner way of prototyping.
##### CMake Build
This project uses CMake version 3.12 and is meant to be built for 32 bit Windows. It will NOT BUILD if using 64 bit.
